## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

### Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes an integer input from the user.
2. Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
3. Displays the result accordingly.

### File Details
- File Name: task1.py
- Concepts Used:
  - User input
  - If-else condition
  - Modulus operator (%)

### Expected Output
